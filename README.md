# ConvertSEP
To generate [tufte-book](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) style document for SEP entries.
## Dependencies
* XeLaTeX, which can be found in standard TeX distributions such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/);
* [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and its python wrapper pypandoc;
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), if `.svg` images are used in the entry.

You may need to add the paths to the `PATH` environment variable, such that `inkscape` and `xelatex` can be called directly from your command-line.

Python packages required are listed in `requirements.txt`, such that they can be installed using `pip`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Various LaTeX packages are also needed in order to successfully compile the `.tex` file generated by ConvertSEP.

## Usage
```
 python ConvertSEPHTML.py <URL to the entry> [<output.tex>]
```
For example:
```
python ConvertSEPHTML.py  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ comte.tex
```
or
```
python ConvertSEPHTML.py  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/
```
which will save the tex output to `output.tex` if no file name is supplied. 

Manual adjustment may be required. For example, in the command `\sepsidenote[<offset>]{note texts}` that wraps `tufte`'s `\sidenote`, the `<offset>` option passed on to `\sidenote` may need to be adjusted manually. Other features in SEP entries currently unsupported can be found (and reported) at [project's issues page](https://github.com/mondain-dev/ConvertSEP/issues). 

XeLaTeX can then be used to compile the output:
```
xelatex comte.tex
xelatex comte.tex # second run to generate the TOC
```
